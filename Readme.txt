## Overview
This project is a console-based Hospital Patient Management System built using Java.
It prioritizes patients based on severity, age, and emergency status using
object-oriented programming and data structures.

## Key Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- Java Collections Framework
- PriorityQueue with Comparable
- HashMap for fast lookup
- LinkedList for treatment history
- AtomicInteger for unique patient ID generation

## System Features
- Add new patients (Normal or Emergency)
- Automatic priority calculation
- Treat patients based on priority
- View current waiting queue
- Search patients by ID
- View treatment history

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Core Java Collections
- Console-based UI
